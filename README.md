# GoFood_Delivery_Project
"Developed a full-stack food delivery web application, Gofood, using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Implemented features for user authentication, placing orders, viewing order history, and managing cart functionality. APIs were tested using Thunder Client. The project does not include real-time order tracking."
